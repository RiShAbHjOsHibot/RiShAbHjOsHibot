- This is a repository I will use to put all the things, which I think are somehow interesting. I am a **lover** of **CREATIVE CODING**. I love creating a new challenge for myself and then trying to solve the problem sometimes takes **DAYS or MONTHS**
- I fell in love with the **LLVM Clang Compiler** and from that day, I am learning it through **Official Manuals** and other docs available. 
- I generally prefer **C / C++** and **Python** for *general purpose tasks*.
